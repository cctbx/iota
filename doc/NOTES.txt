IOTA v1.6.0 - Image scorer and HDF5 speedup

- Implemented image scorer from Interceptor (eventually will keep it in IOTA sources)
- Code to show image scores instead of strong spots in processing tab (commented)
- Significant speed up of importing HDF5 input
  - unique list of filenames (collapses expanded multi-image input lists)
  - types dictionary with unique filepaths
  - HDF5 master file test once per filepath
- Bugfixes:
  - Reference geography browsing dialog is a file dialog now (UI)
  - Run recovery now imports single filenames into input window if only one file per
  path exists (still a problem if a selection of files from folder was read in
  initially; will thus import the entire folder)
