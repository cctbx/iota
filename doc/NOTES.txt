IOTA v1.4.018 - Python3-related bugfixes

- Exception handling
    - Assign exception target value to a separate variable, since exception
      target is cleaned up when except block exits
    - ValueError no longer has a 'message' attribute, change exp.message to str
      (exp) wherever appropriate
- JSON-related issues
    - Import basestring from past.builtins for use in making dictionaries
      serializable for JSON and making all strings the same (especially
      necessary for filepath comparisons elsewhere in code)
    - Convert all NumPY types into corresponding base types (NumPY types are not
      JSON serializable)
    - When collecting processing stats, extract item from NumPy objects, e.g.
      mean=np.mean(stat_list).item(); NumPy objects are not JSON serializable
    - Put the json.dump line into a try block; if a TypeError signals that some
      object is not serializable, try again after passing the dictionary through
      the serialization function.
- Stdout capture
    - Use StringIO from io, rather than from six.moves
- GUI-related fixes
    - sys.maxint doesn't exist in Python3; use sys.maxsize for that purpose
    - In wxtbx.metallicbutton, put import Carbon.Appearance into a try block,
      because it may no longer be included as a separate module with wxPython4
    - Switched xmin, ymin, xmax, and ymax in MatPlotLib to left, bottom, right,
      and top, respectively (hopefully these work for MatPlotLib 2.0!)
    - New PHIL control for MultiChoice drop-down menu (hinky, but will serve)
- Zip objects:
    - change to list(zip(l1, l2)) where I don't want a zip iterator
